# ProcessOS — Worker-Internal and Business-Semantic Layers

## 0. The two ends of the stack

The earlier docs cover the middle: process structure, task binding, resources,
deployment. This one covers the ends — and they sit at opposite corners of the
two axes that organize the whole ProcessOS space:

- the **autonomy axis** (suggest → canary → auto), and
- the **observability/actuation regime** (offline engine-sim → queueing-model-sim
  → live act-and-measure), from `processos-deployment-cooptimization.md` §2.

| End of stack | Position | Character |
|---|---|---|
| **Worker-internal logic** (this doc §1) | low autonomy-cost, highly measurable | instrumentation is *easy*; it strengthens autonomy by harvesting safety data |
| **Business semantics** (this doc §2) | highest value, lowest safe autonomy | the verifier's safety model *breaks*; human judgment is irreducible |

**The structural insight that ties them together (§3): autonomy and value run in
opposite directions as you climb the stack.** The biggest prizes are exactly
where the decision is least automatable — so the system automates the *analysis
and the evidence*, never the *judgment*.

## 1. Client-side business logic — instrument the workers

### 1.1 The problem: the task is a black box

Today a service task is opaque. ProcessOS sees `serviceMs` and the `__cost`
channel (`process-optimization-design.md` §3, §6) **at the job boundary**, but the
business logic *inside* the handler — the DB calls, external APIs, computation,
branching the customer wrote — is invisible. A single `serviceMs` hides a whole
sub-computation. Instrumenting the worker via the SDK turns that **black box into
a white box**, and it is the single highest-leverage data move available, for
four reasons.

### 1.2 (a) Decompose `serviceMs` into a span tree

The worker SDK auto-creates child spans for the operations inside a handler:
outbound HTTP, DB queries, LLM calls, cache hit/miss, compute phases. "This task
is slow" becomes "this task makes five *sequential* DB calls that could be
batched," or "90% of the time is one LLM call." That is the difference between
knowing *that* a task is slow and *why* — and whether the fix is **process-level**
(cache/parallelize the task) or **worker-internal** (fix the handler).

The natural substrate is **OpenTelemetry**: §3 already maps the process trace to
an OTel span tree, so worker spans slot in as *children of the same trace* — one
coherent tree from `CreateInstance` → element → job → handler → outbound call.
No new transport; it rides the existing OTLP read contract
(`processos-design.md` §1.1).

### 1.3 (b) Automatically harvest the safety data

`processos-latent-process-exploration.md` §2 flagged a **per-task
side-effect/purity profile** (pure / idempotent / external-mutating) as the #1
missing signal — the safety gate for nearly every structural transform
(parallelize, cache, speculate, hedge, reorder). **The SDK can derive it by
observation rather than declaration:**

- which hosts / tables / endpoints a handler touches;
- whether it performs external writes;
- whether identical inputs produce identical outputs across instances
  (→ cacheability + a memoization hit-rate estimate);
- whether a retry re-performed the same external write (→ idempotency, which gates
  speculation / hedging / shadow execution).

This is the payoff that promotes a whole class of transforms from "propose-only"
to "auto-applicable." Instrumentation is *how you acquire* the data the
transforms' safety proofs depend on.

### 1.4 (c) The pattern catalogue recurses inside the worker

Once the handler is a white box, the families of
`processos-latent-process-exploration.md` §1 apply one level **down**: batch the
handler's repeated external calls, parallelize its independent sub-calls, cache
its pure sub-computations, dedup identical requests, tune its internal
retries/timeouts. Process-level and worker-internal optimization are the *same
patterns at different scales* — the optimization space is fractal.

### 1.5 (d) Standalone observability value — the adoption wedge

Even before any optimization, the customer gets distributed tracing + cost
attribution of their workers for free. That is a reason to adopt the SDK
instrumentation on its own merits; the optimizer consumes it as a byproduct. APM
value is the wedge; optimization is the compounding return.

### 1.6 How — and the boundary stays one-way

- **Auto-instrumentation (zero-code):** the SDK wraps the handler invocation and
  hooks the HTTP / DB / LLM clients it provides (OTel-style), emitting sub-spans
  with no developer effort.
- **Manual annotations (opt-in):** `ctx.span("phase")`, `ctx.reportCost({ usd,
  tokens, model })` for what the SDK cannot see — e.g. token counts parsed from an
  LLM response body.
- **Privacy / sampling:** same Tier-A/B discipline (`process-optimization-design.md`
  §3, §4) — sample, aggregate-by-default, redact payloads, opt-in value capture.
  Worker internals touch secrets / PII.
- **Boundary:** this is the **customer's worker** emitting telemetry over the
  existing read contract — an **enrichment of the read path, not a new control
  verb.** Nano still never depends on ProcessOS
  (`processos-design.md` §1, §8). The one-way edge is untouched.

### 1.7 The autonomy ceiling: observe → configure → transform

ProcessOS can rewrite BPMN (it is data); it generally **cannot rewrite the
customer's worker code.** So worker-internal optimization is a spectrum, and the
SDK is also the *actuation surface* — the more the worker is expressed through SDK
primitives, the more of this layer ProcessOS can act on rather than merely
observe:

| Worker form | What ProcessOS can do |
|---|---|
| **Opaque customer code** | **Observe + recommend** ("your handler does 5 sequential calls; batch them") |
| **SDK-managed primitives** (batching / caching / hedging wrappers) | **Configure** (turn the primitive on/tune it) |
| **Declarative / generated workers** (embedded Deno workers, connectors) | **Transform** — like BPMN, behind the verifier + sandbox (`process-optimization-design.md` §5.3) |

## 2. The physical business process — the semantic layer

### 2.1 The proxy problem

This is the most important distinction in the entire ProcessOS space: **the BPMN
+ its technical execution is a *proxy* for the real business process. The numbers
optimize the proxy.** The largest wins in business process *redesign* — the
BPR / Lean / Six-Sigma / Theory-of-Constraints kind — live in a semantic layer
**above** the numbers:

- whether a step should *exist at all*;
- whether a sequence reflects an outdated org chart;
- whether an approval adds value or is bureaucratic residue from an incident no
  longer relevant;
- whether the process is solving the *right problem*.

The trace tells you the "Approve" task takes three days. It does **not** tell you
*why* the approval exists, what risk it manages, or what removing it would expose.
That is *intent*, not behavior — and it is invisible to the execution data.

### 2.2 Why the safety model inverts here

At every lower layer, "the verifier and statistics are authoritative; the LLM only
proposes" (`process-optimization-design.md` §8, `processos-design.md` §8) holds.
**At the semantic layer it breaks down — fundamentally, not as a policy choice:**

- The verifier can prove *technical* equivalence (same outputs for same inputs).
  It **cannot** prove *business* soundness — that removing a "redundant" check does
  not expose a tail-risk the objective never encoded (the fraud case that fires 1%
  of the time and is catastrophic).
- **The objective function itself is incomplete** at this layer. It does not
  capture externalities, regulatory mandates, brand, or institutional risk
  tolerance. You cannot let a gate that doesn't measure X authorize a change whose
  whole risk is X.

Therefore semantic candidates are **suggest-only, human-in-the-loop, decision
support** — never an autonomous canary. An LLM confidently proposing to delete
compliance steps is a liability, not a feature.

### 2.3 The LLM as a *grounded* consultant — and why accuracy is the moat

Generic LLM business advice is consulting platitudes. But an LLM that says *"here
is a redesign — and here is the simulated / canaried evidence it saves $X at Y
measured risk on your real traffic"* is something no slide deck and no other BPM
tool can produce. **The technical measurement layer is the credibility engine for
the semantic layer.** This is the §0 "the moat is not the LLM" thesis extended
upward: the moat is the LLM *grounded in faithful execution data*.

Given the right inputs, advanced LLM analysis can genuinely propose semantic
candidates — using *world knowledge and reasoning*, not trace pattern-matching:

- **Read the process semantically** from element names / docs / structure, infer
  what it is *for*, and compare against how a typical order-to-cash / claims /
  loan-origination process *should* look (it knows the domain anti-patterns).
- **Apply named BPR/Lean frameworks:** flag non-value-adding steps (waste),
  hand-off-heavy segments (org-structure smell), rework loops, over-processing,
  the binding constraint (Theory of Constraints).
- **Question existence, anchored in the numbers:** *"98% auto-approve at the
  threshold — why does every order still route through manual credit review?
  Handle the 2% as an exception."* A semantic hypothesis reaching above the
  numbers but grounded by them.

### 2.4 The data the semantic layer needs (that the trace lacks)

| Signal | Why | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Intent / purpose metadata** — *why* each step exists, what risk/value it manages | distinguishes residue from load-bearing controls | BPMN documentation / annotations, linked policies |
| **Business-outcome / value ground-truth** — value produced, cost of a failure | the real objective above latency/cost; generalizes the latent doc's delayed correctness signal + §6 `slaViolationCost` | downstream business systems, with lag |
| **Regulatory & org context** — which steps are *legally mandated*; the role / hand-off map; risk tolerance | hard constraints the optimizer must never cross | RAG over policies / SOPs / compliance docs |
| **SME feedback** — experts marking suggestions good/bad | trains *this business's* priors | the §9 feedback ledger, extended from technical to semantic judgments |

## 3. Synthesis — the inverted ladder, and one product or two

### 3.1 Autonomy descends as value climbs

| Layer | Example change | Decided by | Autonomy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resource / parameter | scale workers, tune timeout | verifier + statistics | **high** (auto) |
| Structural transform | parallelize, cache | verifier proves equivalence, canary confirms | medium |
| Task binding | swap model within quality bar | quality signal + canary | medium |
| Worker-internal (§1) | batch handler's DB calls | observe→configure→transform (§1.7) | low–medium |
| **Business semantic (§2)** | remove / merge / re-purpose a step | **human expert; numbers as evidence** | **zero (advisory)** |

The relationship is **inverse**: the higher the value of the optimization, the
lower the safe autonomy and the more it depends on human judgment + business
context. The system automates the *analysis and the evidence*; the *judgment*
stays human at the top.

### 3.2 ProcessOS is really two products sharing one substrate

1. **An autonomous technical optimizer** (resources → structure → binding →
   worker internals): closed-loop, manager-invisible, makes the process
   cheaper/faster within *proven-safe* bounds. §1 (worker instrumentation) is the
   bottom of this — and it *strengthens* autonomy by harvesting the safety data
   (§1.3).
2. **A business-redesign copilot** (the semantic layer): an LLM consultant,
   grounded in the accurate technical measurements, proposing higher-order
   redesigns for human experts, with the measurement rig as evidence. §2 is the
   top — highest value, lowest autonomy, hardest to measure (business outcomes are
   delayed and externality-laden).

The through-line: the optimization patterns and the observability regimes recur
**fractally** — across the process, across the deployment, inside the worker, and
above the process. Two axes (autonomy × observability regime) place every layer.
§1 sits low-left (measurable, fairly autonomous). §2 sits top-right (the biggest
prize, the least automatable decision).

### 3.3 The load-bearing risk

The temptation is to let the impressive accuracy of the lower layers lend **false
authority** to the semantic suggestions at the top. The product must
**structurally separate** them: semantic candidates carry an explicit *"this may
have business / regulatory implications the system cannot measure"* boundary, and
never enter an autonomous canary path. The credibility of the whole system depends
on **not overclaiming at the top** — the verifier is authoritative only where it
can actually verify.

## 4. Invariants this must not break

- **One-way dependency holds.** Worker instrumentation is a *read-contract
  enrichment* (the customer's worker emits OTel over OTLP), not a new control
  verb; Nano never depends on ProcessOS (`processos-design.md` §1, §8).
- **Privacy is opt-in and redacted.** Worker internals and business-value /
  intent data carry secrets, PII, and confidential policy — Tier-B discipline:
  opt-in, TTL, redaction, aggregate-by-default
  (`process-optimization-design.md` §4).
- **The verifier is authoritative only within its reach.** Technical layers stay
  verifier-gated; the semantic layer is explicitly *advisory* — the safety model
  does not pretend to cover what it cannot measure (§2.2).
- **Absent-safe.** None of this is required to run a cluster; instrumentation and
  the semantic copilot are opt-in, and the engine is unchanged.

---

*This document adds the two ends of the ProcessOS stack: worker-internal logic —
where SDK instrumentation turns each task from a black box into a white box,
harvests the side-effect/purity safety data, recurses the pattern catalogue one
level down, and offers an observe→configure→transform actuation spectrum — and the
business-semantic layer, where the verifier's safety model inverts, autonomy drops
to advisory, and an LLM grounded in faithful measurement becomes a business-
redesign copilot for human experts. It changes no engine code; every Nano-side
implication is a public-contract enrichment, never an engine-core change.*
