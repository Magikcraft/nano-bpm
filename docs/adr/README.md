# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds Nano's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Each ADR captures one decision — its
context, the choice made, its consequences, and the questions left open — in a durable, numbered
document. ADRs are append-only: rather than rewrite a superseded decision, a later ADR revises or
supersedes it and says so in its `Status` / `Relates to` header.

New ADRs take the next free number and follow the house shape: a `# ADR NNNN — <title>` heading, then
`Status:` / `Date:` / `Relates to:` headers, then `## Context`, `## Decision`, `## Consequences`, and
`## Open questions`. This table is the index; the ADR files themselves are the source of truth.

## Reading paths

The ADRs fall into a few coherent threads:

- **Engine & cluster internals** (throughput, durability, fairness, admission): 0001–0003, 0012–0014,
  0016, 0017, 0019, 0020. The performance and correctness substrate of the Raft-clustered engine.
- **SLA & time** as first-class: 0013, 0021 — culminating in the "state with a future tense" view.
- **Investigator / agent tooling**: 0004, 0006, 0010, 0011 — the eval harness and human-in-the-loop
  surfaces.
- **RAD / IDE platform**: 0005 (**Bernd**, the embedded engine), 0007–0009 (the pack system, language
  packs, served-UI binaries) — the foundation the Urban App bundle grows from.
- **Urban — the Nano RAD Application**: 0022 (the product keystone) and its expansions — 0023 (agentic
  parity), 0024 (data layer), 0025 (triggers), 0026 (human surfaces), 0027 (manifest spec), 0028
  (auth/identity), 0029 (bindings & domain model) — resting on the conceptual keystone **0030** (the
  domain–process duality: why Urban is a distinct kind of computing) and its mapping mechanism **0031**
  (the Process-Relational Mapper: how one domain type stays coherent across form, engine, and database),
  and its API surface **0032** (the domain-resource API: the domain object as a first-class, typed,
  self-describing REST resource whose CRUD verbs are its lifecycle — the Kogito seam), and its
  component palette **0033** (element templates as first-class Urban components: the Delphi
  drag-a-component ergonomic returns to the process canvas, fusing design/runtime/data).
- **Philosophy / signature**: 0015 (artists sign their work) and 0030 (the computational primitive) —
  the pieces that state *why*, not just *what*.
