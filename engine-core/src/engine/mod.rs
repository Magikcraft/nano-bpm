//! The engine: a single-writer command/event/applier loop.
//!
//! [`Engine::apply_command`] is the one entry point that changes anything. It:
//!
//! 1. validates the [`Command`] and emits the top-level event(s),
//! 2. drives an internal work queue of [`Step`]s — the BPMN element lifecycle —
//!    until the instance is quiescent (finished, or resting on a job/incident),
//! 3. detects process-instance completion,
//!
//! applying every event through [`state::apply`] as it goes. The processor
//! ([`Engine::process_step`]) only *reads* state and *decides*; it never mutates.
