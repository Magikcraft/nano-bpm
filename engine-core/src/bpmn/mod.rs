//! A minimal BPMN 2.0 XML parser.
//!
//! This turns the slice of BPMN that the engine understands into
//! [`ProcessDefinition`]s, so processes can be deployed from `.bpmn` files
//! (e.g. exported by the Camunda Modeler) instead of only being built
//! programmatically with [`crate::ProcessBuilder`].
//!
//! It is deliberately tiny and dependency-free: a hand-rolled, namespace-prefix
//! agnostic XML scanner plus a single pass that recognises the supported flow
//! nodes. It is **not** a conformant BPMN/XML implementation — it understands
//! exactly the constructs the engine can execute and ignores the rest
//! (diagram interchange, documentation, lanes, …).
//!
//! ## Supported subset
//!
//! * `process` (one or more per file) with its `id`.
//! * Flow nodes: `startEvent`, `endEvent` (plain none end, or — with a nested
//!   `terminateEventDefinition` — a terminate end that kills the remaining
//!   tokens in its enclosing scope), `task`/`manualTask` (abstract
//!   pass-through), `serviceTask`, `sendTask` (a job-based service task — its
//!   throwing cousin of `receiveTask`), `userTask`, `exclusiveGateway`,
//!   `parallelGateway`, `inclusiveGateway`, `eventBasedGateway`.
//! * `subProcess` (embedded): its nested flow nodes/flows are scoped to it, and
//!   a `boundaryEvent` with an `errorEventDefinition` attached to it becomes an
//!   interrupting error boundary on the sub-process.
//! * `intermediateCatchEvent` with a nested `timerEventDefinition`/`timeDuration`
//!   (timer catch) or a nested `messageEventDefinition` (message catch).
//! * Link events: an `intermediateThrowEvent` with a `linkEventDefinition name`
//!   (a link *throw*) and an `intermediateCatchEvent` with a matching
//!   `linkEventDefinition name` (a link *catch*). The throw has no outgoing flow
//!   and the catch no incoming flow; on completion the throw hands its token to
//!   the matching catch in the same scope, which then routes onward — the
//!   standard "page-break connector" idiom. Reference integrity (every throw has
//!   a matching, unique catch) is enforced at deploy
//!   (Zeebe `ModelUtil.verifyLinkIntermediateEvents`).
//! * `boundaryEvent` with `attachedToRef` and a nested `errorEventDefinition`
//!   `errorRef`, resolved against definitions-level `error` elements
//!   (`<error id="…" errorCode="…">`) into an error boundary event; or a nested
//!   `timerEventDefinition` (timer boundary); or a nested `messageEventDefinition`
//!   (message boundary); or a nested `compensateEventDefinition` (compensation
//!   boundary — see below). `cancelActivity="false"` makes a timer or message
//!   boundary **non-interrupting** (the activity keeps running and a parallel
//!   token is spawned on each fire); the default is interrupting.
//! * Compensation: a `boundaryEvent` with a `compensateEventDefinition`, wired
//!   via an `<association sourceRef targetRef>` to an `isForCompensation` handler
//!   activity, marks its attached activity compensable. A
//!   `compensateEventDefinition` on an `intermediateThrowEvent`/`endEvent`
//!   triggers compensation: the completed compensable activities in scope have
//!   their handlers run (reverse completion order), and the throw event rests
//!   until they finish before routing onward (single-activity path).
//! * Escalation (#1173): an `escalationEventDefinition` on an
//!   `intermediateThrowEvent`/`endEvent` raises the referenced escalation code;
//!   an `escalationEventDefinition` on a `boundaryEvent` (attached to an
//!   embedded sub-process) catches a matching code raised inside that
//!   activity's scope, propagating up the enclosing scopes (an exact code beats
//!   a catch-all with no `escalationRef`). `cancelActivity="false"` (the
//!   escalation default idiom) makes the boundary non-interrupting — the
//!   activity keeps running and a parallel token is spawned; interrupting tears
//!   the activity's scope down. An uncaught escalation is ignored (no incident),
//!   matching Zeebe. Escalation is non-critical, so the throw always continues.
//! * Definitions-level `message` elements (`<message id="…" name="…">`) with a
//!   nested `zeebe:subscription correlationKey="=var"`, referenced by message
//!   catch/boundary events via `messageRef`.
//! * A service task's job type is taken from a nested
//!   `zeebe:taskDefinition type="…"`; if absent it defaults to the task id. A
//!   FEEL expression (`type="=jobType"`, `type='="worker-" + region'`) is
//!   evaluated against the instance variables at job-creation time via
//!   [`crate::feel`]; an expression that cannot be evaluated falls back to the
//!   literal text (no incident is raised).
//! * A user task's assignment/scheduling/priority attributes come from nested
//!   `zeebe:assignmentDefinition` (`assignee`, `candidateGroups`,
//!   `candidateUsers`), `zeebe:taskSchedule` (`dueDate`, `followUpDate`) and
//!   `zeebe:priorityDefinition` (`priority`). Each may be a literal or a FEEL
//!   expression resolved against the instance variables when the task is created.
//!   Its form linkage comes from nested `zeebe:formDefinition` (`formId` for an
//!   embedded/deployment form, resolved to a numeric form key at task creation
//!   under the default `latest` binding — a `deployment`/`versionTag`
//!   `bindingType` is rejected at deploy rather than silently degraded, #1190;
//!   `externalReference` for an external form).
//! * `sequenceFlow` with `sourceRef`/`targetRef`, and an optional
//!   `conditionExpression` whose FEEL body is stored verbatim and evaluated by
//!   [`crate::feel`] at a condition-routed gateway — exclusive (XOR) or
//!   inclusive (OR) (comparisons, arithmetic, boolean logic, member access — not
//!   just equality). A condition that fails to
//!   evaluate to a boolean raises an `ExpressionEvaluation` incident.
//! * A `serviceTask` bearing a `zeebe:agentDefinition agentType="aiAgentTask"`
//!   (or `"external"`) extension marker remains an ordinary
//!   [`ServiceTask`](crate::model::ElementKind::ServiceTask), with agent metadata.
//!   It creates a normal job; the worker explicitly registers its AgentInstance
//!   via `CreateAgentInstance`. Supplied job attribution is lease-validated,
//!   and history-bearing requests require it. Its job type comes from a co-located
//!   `zeebe:taskDefinition type` (literal or FEEL), or the element id when absent.
//!   Placement mirrors Camunda's
//!   `AgentDefinitionValidator`: `aiAgentTask` is only valid on a `serviceTask`
//!   and `aiAgentSubProcess` only on an `adHocSubProcess`; the wrong placement
//!   (or an unknown `agentType`) is rejected at parse time.
//! * `zeebe:executionListeners` / nested `zeebe:executionListener`
//!   (`eventType` `start`/`end`, ADR 0037): parsed on activities (including
//!   `receiveTask`, which rides the `io_stack` like the other plain tasks),
//!   sub-processes, ad-hoc/call containers, **gateways** (exclusive/parallel/
//!   inclusive/event-based), **start events**, and **boundary events** (#1197).
//!   Each
//!   listener attaches to its own element (activities/gateways/start & end events
//!   ride the `io_stack`; a boundary event carries its listeners on the buffered
//!   boundary and re-attaches them by id at build) and fires through the shared
//!   activation/completion listener gate. A listener that could never fire is
//!   rejected at deploy rather than dropped (`UnsupportedExecutionListener`):
//!   a multi-incoming parallel gateway (a *join* — both phases), the `start`
//!   listener of a multi-incoming inclusive gateway (its `end` listener IS
//!   supported), a compensation boundary event, the `end` listener of a
//!   terminate end event (its `start` listener IS supported), a listener on a
//!   surplus signal start event (demoted to an inert throw), a **tool of an
//!   ad-hoc sub-process** (pruned leaf tools and directly-activated embedded
//!   tools both bypass the listener gate), and a sequence-flow ("take") listener
//!   (edges, not elements — deferred, #1198). A listener on the `<process>`
//!   itself is likewise rejected — the process element has no activation/
//!   completion lifecycle and is never ridden by a token. A `zeebe:taskListener`
//!   declared on
//!   a non-user-task element is likewise rejected (`UnsupportedTaskListener`),
//!   since task-listener jobs only run on the user-task path.
