//! Post-parse validation seam (deploy-validation parity, epic #850).
//!
//! After [`crate::bpmn::parse_bpmn`] assembles a [`ProcessDefinition`], every
//! validator registered in [`VALIDATORS`] runs in sequence over a
//! [`ValidationInput`] — the built definition plus the raw [`ProcessCapture`]
//! the streaming parser recorded (reference sites, unmodelled tags, declared
//! definition ids, …). The first validator to reject returns its [`ParseError`].
//!
//! ## How to add a rule (for the wave-1 sibling slices of #850)
//!
//! Each sibling implements its rule by editing **only** the body of its own
//! pre-created stub module below. A sibling **must not** edit this file
//! (`validate/mod.rs`), the [`ParseError`](crate::bpmn::ParseError) enum, or
//! [`crate::bpmn`]'s streaming parser: the validator is already registered here,
//! every [`ParseError`] variant it needs is already declared, and every
//! reference site / unmodelled tag it must inspect is already captured on
//! [`ProcessCapture`]. The rule only *reads* pre-captured data and returns
//! `Err(ParseError::…)` on a violation.
//!
//! * `incoming_outgoing` — dangling `<incoming>`/`<outgoing>` references (#849).
//! * `references`        — generic reference integrity (#851).
//! * `unsupported_elements` — unmodelled flow elements / event defs (#853).
//! * `gateway_conditions` — gateway condition-or-default (#854).
//! * `start_events`      — start-event count parity (#855).
//! * `cheap_rules`       — end-event outgoing / duplicate starts / taskDef (#856).
