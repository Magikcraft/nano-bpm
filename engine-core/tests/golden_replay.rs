//! Golden old-journal replay regression tests (issue #1070, L4 of the
//! snapshot-durability epic #1067; incident #1065).
//!
//! # What this guards
//!
//! Migration-by-replay rebuilds the engine by **replaying the event journal**
//! under the current binary. That only works if OLD events still deserialize and
//! replay into the SAME engine state a live run produced — the property that
//! broke in incident #1065 (a replay that silently rewound the key high-water,
//! re-minting `instance 41`). This file locks that property in as a regression
//! guard by replaying the checked-in golden journal and asserting it
//! reconstructs the golden snapshot's state.
//!
//! It **reuses** the golden corpus owned by #1069 (L3) — it does not fork or
//! duplicate it. See `engine-core/tests/fixtures/golden/README.md`:
//!
//! * `event_corpus.v{N}.json` — an ordered, replayable `Vec<Event>` journal.
//! * `engine_snapshot.v{N}.json` — the `EngineSnapshot` that same scenario
//!   produced (`build_golden_corpus()` in `golden_serde_drift.rs`).
//!
//! Both are pinned to [`SNAPSHOT_FORMAT_VERSION`], so a version bump repoints
//! these tests at the fresh `v{N}` corpus while the prior `v{N-1}` files stay
//! checked in for #1071's cross-version replay-migrator.
//!
//! # Three replay risks covered
//!
//! 1. **Whole-journal replay parity** — the golden journal replays into exactly
//!    the golden state (key high-water included).
//! 2. **Forward-compat of additive fields** — a legacy record missing a
//!    now-`#[serde(default)]` field still decodes and replays (the contract that
//!    makes additive changes safe).
//! 3. **Unknown/removed variant rejection** — an unrecognized event variant is a
//!    typed [`EventDecodeError::UnknownVariant`], never a silent drop or panic.
//!
//! # CRITICAL: `--features serde`
//!
//! The `Event`/`EngineSnapshot` serde derives are feature-gated, so this whole
//! file is `#![cfg(feature = "serde")]` and must be built/run with
//! `--features serde` (the `engine-core (clippy + test)` CI job #1069 wired
//! already passes it; this task reuses that job and does not re-add the flag).
