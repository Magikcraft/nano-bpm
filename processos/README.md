# ProcessOS

The runtime **process-optimization plane** for Nano BPM — a separate component, on
the principle that **Nano handles production, ProcessOS handles optimization.**

It runs as its own process with its own webserver and talks to a Nano cluster *only*
over Nano's public HTTP contracts. The dependency is one-way: ProcessOS reads Nano;
**Nano never depends on ProcessOS** and runs unaffected when this binary is absent.

See [`../docs/processos-index.md`](../docs/processos-index.md) for the design-series
reading guide, [`../docs/processos-design.md`](../docs/processos-design.md) for where
the optimizer lives and its contracts, and
[`../docs/process-optimization-design.md`](../docs/process-optimization-design.md) for
the optimization loop it implements.

## Status

The optimization rig and the self-hosting **cockpit** are built and green
(`make processos-test`). The loop is **measure → calibrate → hypothesize → rank →
replay**, and it is **suggest-only**: nothing is actuated automatically — the engine
stays untouched and a human/verifier decides.

Milestones (design §7.4): **M0** (`SimRunner`), **M1** (baked candidate ranking) and
**M2** (LLM hypothesis) are done; **M3** (real-cluster realism + the live production
path) has its measurement/queueing/calibration substrate built. The §10 "cockpit"
build adds the human↔droid framing: an editable, **forkable pilot process**, a
persisted cockpit conversation, a prompt library, and ProcessOS's **own supervised
Nano engine** for the pilot loop.

Deliberately deferred (not gaps — see §7.6): a full discrete-event simulator, the
**actuating** scaling/fleet control verb, portfolio (cross-process) scope.

## Architecture — two engines

ProcessOS distinguishes the two Nano engines it talks to (design §1.4):

- **target** — the client's **production** engine. **Read-only**: ProcessOS folds its
  exported traces + metrics into Insights and a measured baseline. It never writes here.
- **own** — an engine ProcessOS **supervises** for its *pilot loop*: it can spawn the
  gateway as a child process, learn its port, deploy the pilot BPMN on boot, and reap
  it on shutdown. The self-optimizing loop and its meta-workers run here, never on the
  client's engine.

With no env set both roles resolve to the same local gateway, so a single-machine dev
setup "just works".

## The optimization harness (design §7)

The harness embeds the **real `engine-core`** (a one-way `path` dependency) and drives
it with a virtual clock to evaluate process variants. A **scenario** supplies a test
model, seeded **mock workers** (cost / latency / failure models), **latent
worker-swap options** (the MVP transform space), and **inputs carrying expected
outputs**. The `SimRunner` runs every candidate over every input and ranks them across
cost / latency / incident-rate / correctness, reporting whether exploration recovered
the optional **golden** variant. It is deterministic: same scenario + seed ⇒ same
ranking.

Beyond the synthetic baseline, the harness grounds itself on **real** data:

- **ClusterRunner / cluster read** (`harness/cluster.rs`) — cluster-aware
  measurement: discovers every node via `GET /v2/topology` and **unions** their
  partition-local traces, reporting throughput, the e2e tail (p50/p95/p99), the
  per-job-type **queue-vs-service split**, and per-node backlog (`byNode`).
- **Queueing recommender** (`harness/queueing.rs`) — an `M/M/c` (Erlang-C) worker-pool
  model fitted from the measured λ/S, answering *how many workers to hold p99
  queue-wait < X?* Advisory only.
- **Calibration** (`harness/calibrate.rs`) — overrides the SimRunner's hand-authored
  per-task service time / failure rate with **measured** distributions, so candidates
  are scored against the bar production actually set.
- **Recorded-input replay** (`harness/replay.rs`, `replay_rank.rs`, `evolve.rs`) — the
  Level-2 verifier: replay a historical instance's **real** creation inputs + ordered
  stimuli (captured opt-in on Nano's trace, see below) against a candidate model and
  rank by fidelity gradient.

### LLM hypothesis (M2)

Instead of (or alongside) the baked worker-swap grid, an LLM can *propose* candidates.
The model only generates hypotheses — the harness still measures and ranks them with
the SimRunner, so an improvement that doesn't actually help is exposed by the numbers.
The model is reached through a **pluggable client**, so the same path serves a local
model on your network and a hosted API:

- `openai` — the OpenAI **chat-completions** shape, spoken by local `llama.cpp`
  (`--api`), Ollama (`/v1`), vLLM, LM Studio, and OpenAI. **Default.**
- `anthropic` — the Anthropic **messages** API.

The **system prompt** is itself an experimental variable: an authorable, selectable
`PromptLibrary` (`harness/prompts.rs`), seeded with the built-in default and optionally
imported from `PROCESSOS_PROMPTS_DIR`. `POST /api/harness/hypothesize` selects by
precedence **inline `prompt` > `promptId` > built-in default**.

| Env | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `PROCESSOS_LLM_PROVIDER` | `openai` | `openai` (local/llama.cpp/ollama/vllm) or `anthropic` |
| `PROCESSOS_LLM_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1` (openai) / `https://api.anthropic.com` (anthropic) | Endpoint base |
| `PROCESSOS_LLM_MODEL` | _(required)_ | Model name |
| `PROCESSOS_LLM_API_KEY` | _(none)_ | Bearer / `x-api-key`; local models usually need none |
| `PROCESSOS_LLM_MAX_TOKENS` | `2048` | Completion budget |
| `PROCESSOS_LLM_TEMPERATURE` | `0.2` | Sampling temperature |

These are *defaults*; the console **Settings** panel (the gear in the lower-left of the
console and cockpit) manages one or more named **LLM profiles** — switch the *active*
profile, add/delete profiles, and **Fetch** an endpoint's model list to pick a model id
(the fetch also reads each model's **context window** — llama.cpp's `meta.n_ctx`,
`n_ctx_train`, or a `context_length`-style field — and fills the Max-tokens budget from it).
It ships with a `Local (llama.cpp)` profile pointing at `http://localhost:8888/v1`.
Profiles + the active selection + the global Python interpreter persist to
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/processos/settings.json` (overridable with
`PROCESSOS_CONFIG_DIR`; written `0600` as it may hold an API key). The effective config
layers **built-in default → `PROCESSOS_LLM_*` env → active profile → per-request
`llm` override**, each winning when present — so the console is authoritative over the
environment without a relaunch. The panel also configures `PROCESSOS_PYTHON`
(the `run_python` interpreter). See the [settings endpoints](#endpoints).

### Local model sidecar — run llama.cpp from ProcessOS (`src/llama.rs`)

ProcessOS can supervise a local **`llama-server`** (llama.cpp) so the operator never has to
launch one in a separate terminal. In the Settings panel, tick **"Served by local llama.cpp
sidecar"** on a profile and give it a **Model file / HF spec** — either a Hugging Face
`repo[:quant]` spec (e.g. `unsloth/Qwen3-4B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL`, downloaded on demand) or a
`.gguf` path resolved against the **Models directory**. **Startup args** (e.g.
`-ngl 99 -c 32768 --jinja`) are appended verbatim. The global **Local model server** section
sets the shared **Models directory** (pre-filled with llama.cpp's own cache —
`$LLAMA_CACHE`, else macOS `~/Library/Caches/llama.cpp` / Linux `~/.cache/llama.cpp` — so
models are shared with any separately-run llama.cpp) and an optional **llama-server binary**
path (otherwise found on `PATH`).

**Start sidecar / Stop** spawn and kill the process; sidecars are also stopped on graceful
shutdown. The port is parsed from the profile's Base URL (so the profile both *launches* and
*talks to* the same endpoint). **Logs** opens a streaming viewer that tails the process
output and shows the **equivalent terminal command** (including `LLAMA_CACHE=…`) so you can
run it yourself instead. Fresh installs ship four sidecar profiles — **Gemma 4** (needs
~48 GB) and **Qwen 3.6** (needs ~64 GB) plus **Qwen3-8B** (~16 GB) and **Qwen3-4B** (~8 GB)
for resource-constrained machines — each on its **own port** (`8888`–`8891`).

**Up to two sidecars run at once.** An investigation can drive a **primary** model plus, optionally,
one **partner** — a sparring partner (Pair AI) or a loop **monitor** — and both can be local. The
supervisor runs at most **two** `llama-server` children, each on a distinct port; starting a third,
re-starting one already up, or starting two that share a port is rejected with a clear message
(give each sidecar profile its own port in its Base URL). See the [llama endpoints](#endpoints).

**First-class `LLM sidecars` nav surface.** The left rail — the principal navigation menu shown
on every page after the landing page (cockpit and workspaces share it) — carries a first-class
**LLM sidecars** entry with a live **status dot**: **green** when *any* sidecar is up, **yellow**
when off. The entry opens a dedicated view that lists every sidecar-capable profile, shows each
**running** sidecar with its own **Stop / Logs** (plus **Stop all**), warns when two profiles
**share a port**, and offers **Start / Make active** inline (the same controls as the Settings
cog, promoted to a top-level surface). Other pages deep-link into a named cockpit view via
`/cockpit?view=sidecars` (also `console`, `processes`, `prompts`, `experiments`).

**Active-model roster + partner exclusion.** Beside the investigation's **Send** button a roster
shows which models are active — the **primary** plus any enabled **pair**/**monitor** partner —
each with a dot (green = its sidecar is running, yellow = configured-but-off, blue = remote). A
model can hold only one role: the partner pickers exclude the primary (and each other), and the
primary send-menu **disables** whatever profile is acting as the partner, so you can't send the
investigation message to the model that's meant to be the sparring partner.

**Just-in-time start from chat.** If the primary chat profile **or an enabled partner** is a
sidecar that isn't up yet, sending a cockpit message prompts **"Sidecar(s) not started. Start
them now?"** — *Yes* starts the missing ones, waits for each model to finish loading (polling
`GET /api/llama/ready?profileId=…`, which probes `llama-server`'s `/health`), then sends; *No*
leaves the message in the composer unsent.


## Workspaces — bounded contexts & processes (multi-tenant + datasets)

A consultant manages many engagements, so ProcessOS roots a **workspace tree** of
`workspaces / processes` on disk (`src/workspace.rs`). A **workspace** is a bounded
context for one customer/deployment. Each process **binds** to a trace source —
either a **live** Nano instance (`targetUrl`) or a **loaded dataset** (a folder of
instance-trace JSON, or a sibling `traces/` folder) — and the Insights report is
folded over whichever source is bound (`src/dataset.rs`, `report::build_over`).
Folders are scanned from disk, so a consultant can curate a workspace folder
structure by hand and it shows up; the CRUD API also creates them. The front door
is `/workspace`: browse workspaces → open one → open a process to see its **rendered
BPMN model** (vendored bpmn-js viewer, served from `/assets/bpmn/`) and Insights,
then **Reason in cockpit →** to investigate the bound trace with the droid.

```
<PROCESSOS_WORKSPACES_DIR>/
  <workspace-slug>/
    workspace.json
    <process-slug>/
      process.json          # { displayName, targetUrl? | dataset?, objective?, notes? }
      model.bpmn            # optional process model (rendered in the browser)
      traces/               # optional dataset folder (else `dataset` points elsewhere)
```

A process is `live` when `targetUrl` is set, `dataset` when a `dataset` path or a
`traces/` folder resolves, else `unbound`. Slugs are single, lowercased
`[a-z0-9-_]` path segments (no traversal). Browse it at `/workspace`.

**Load the demo dataset in one click:** `POST /api/workspaces/seed-demo` (or the
"Load demo dataset" button) creates the **Northwind Bank** workspace + **Loan
Approval** process, generates a labelled trace corpus into its `traces/` folder, and
writes `model.bpmn` — ready to view and investigate.

A dataset folder holds per-instance `*.json` files (each a
`GET /console/api/traces/{key}` shape) at top level or under `instances/`/`traces/`,
and/or a single `traces.json` array, plus an optional `metrics.json`.

## Synthetic trace corpus — labelled benchmark for domain inference (`src/corpus.rs`)

To exercise the distributed-sensing goal *without a running server*, ProcessOS can
**synthesise a labelled trace corpus** from a "before" archetype process plus a thin
infra sidecar. It runs the **real** `engine-core` per instance for the logical path
(branching, errors) and overlays timing analytically: lognormal service times + an
M/M/c queue-wait sampled against a **time-varying arrival schedule**. The result is a
`traces.json` array — byte-compatible with a real Nano capture, so it loads straight
into a workspace `DatasetSource` — carrying a **planted pathology** (e.g. an
under-provisioned job whose queue tail spikes weekday 09–12) and a ground-truth label.

A `pack.json` describes the scenario; the bundled
`corpus-packs/loan-approval/` plants a 2-worker `credit-check` bureau pool overloaded
by an 8× weekday-morning arrival spike:

```bash
# generate ~10k instances of traffic over a 14-day horizon
processos gen corpus-packs/loan-approval/pack.json /tmp/loan-corpus
#  -> traces.json (load via a workspace dataset) + metrics.json + expected.json

# run the inference + score it against the planted label
processos infer /tmp/loan-corpus 500   # 500ms p99-wait staffing target
#  -> bottleneckJob credit-check, window weekday-morning, recommendedWorkers 44
#  -> SCORE {"domainOk":true,"jobOk":true,"windowOk":true,"points":3,"maxPoints":3}
```

The inference time-buckets per-`(job, window)` queue means, localises the tail to the
job + temporal window with the largest peak-vs-off-peak inflation, fits the peak arrival
rate to an Erlang-C staffing recommendation, and classifies the domain — then `score`
grades that against `expected.json` (domain + job + window = 3 points). The generator is
the symmetric write-side of `replay.rs`, so a corpus also feeds `replay-rank`/`evolve`.

## Camunda 8 import — analyse existing C8 history offline (`src/camunda_import.rs`)

A consultant often has a customer's **Camunda 8 / Zeebe** history but no Nano engine.
`import-camunda` folds a C8 record export into the same `traces.json` dataset shape, so
that history loads straight into a workspace `DatasetSource` — no engine, no Java.

Camunda brokers stream every state change as an ordered `Record<?>` log; the
Elasticsearch/Opensearch and debug-log exporters persist those as JSON. This is the
offline counterpart of the Nano gateway's in-engine fold (`server/src/console/trace.rs`):
the same projection, run over Camunda's records. The intent vocabularies map ~1:1
(`PROCESS_INSTANCE` element lifecycle → instance/element timing; `JOB`
CREATED/COMPLETED/FAILED + `JOB_BATCH` ACTIVATED → job queue/service split & failures;
`INCIDENT` CREATED → incidents; `PROCESS_INSTANCE_CREATION` → Tier-1 creation variables;
`JOB` COMPLETED variables → Tier-2 `jobCompleted` stimulus log for recorded-input replay).

```bash
# input may be a file or a directory of NDJSON / JSON-array / ES `_search` dumps
processos import-camunda ./zeebe-records.ndjson /tmp/c8-dataset
#  -> traces.json (load via a workspace dataset); prints a fold summary
#  -> { recordsRead, traces, completed, withCreationVariables, withStimuli, processes, … }

processos import-camunda ./zeebe-records.ndjson /tmp/c8-dataset --no-tier2  # skip stimulus capture
```

**Fidelity tiers.** Tier-0 (instance + element durations + jobs + incidents) is always
produced. Tier-1 (`creationVariables`) needs the `PROCESS_INSTANCE_CREATION` record. Tier-2
(`stimuli`) captures `jobCompleted` outputs only — a model that also consumes messages,
timers, or user-task inputs is therefore only partially replayable. The queue-vs-service
split needs `JOB_BATCH ACTIVATED` records in the export; without them the whole job wait is
reported as `serviceMs`.

See **[`docs/processos-camunda-import.md`](../docs/processos-camunda-import.md)** for the
full reference: the complete record→trace mapping, accepted input layouts, getting records
out of Camunda, known limits, and the path from this offline transformer to an in-engine
Zeebe exporter.

## LLM-driven investigation — open-ended sensing over the data (`src/analysis.rs`, `agent.rs`, `investigate.rs`)

The pre-built analyzers above (`corpus::infer`, `queueing`, `cluster`) encode *our*
priors. The research goal is the opposite: can the cockpit droid **reason over the trace
data and form its own hypotheses**? To open the hypothesis space, ProcessOS flattens a
bound trace source into in-memory **DuckDB** tables and gives the model a single
**read-only** `query_traces(sql)` tool — so it writes SQL, sees the result, and reasons,
instead of picking from a fixed menu.

- `analysis.rs` — flattens traces into `instances` / `jobs` / `incidents` tables with the
  cheap temporal primitives pre-derived (`hour`, `dow`, `is_weekend`, a real
  `started_ts`) but **no** pre-bucketed "windows" (that labelling is the inference we want
  the droid to perform). `query()` admits a single `SELECT`/`WITH` only — DDL/DML are
  rejected — over an ephemeral in-memory connection.
- `agent.rs` — a provider-agnostic tool-calling loop (`run_agent`) over an `AgentStep`
  transport (OpenAI/llama.cpp `chat/completions` tool-calls today), unit-testable with a
  deterministic mock. Every query+result is recorded as a reproducible **lab notebook**.
- `investigate.rs` — wires the two: a system prompt that imposes analytical discipline
  (state a hypothesis before querying, report effect size + sample size, replicate on a
  held-out slice before concluding) and emits a gradeable JSON conclusion.
- `pyrunner.rs` — the optional **Python escape hatch** (`run_python`): for hypotheses SQL
  can't express (distribution fitting, changepoint/seasonal decomposition, clustering).
  Off by default; pass `"allowPython": true`. The tables are exported as CSV to a private
  temp workdir and a **dependency-tolerant preamble** loads them as `pandas` DataFrames +
  a `duckdb` connection when those libs are present (`HAVE_PANDAS` / `HAVE_DUCKDB` flags),
  degrading to stdlib `csv` row-dicts otherwise — so it works on a bare interpreter too.
  It runs **arbitrary operator-trusted code** (a trusted-operator hatch, *not* a security
  sandbox) with pragmatic rails: a private workdir, a wall-clock timeout (child killed on
  overrun), and an output cap. Env: `PROCESSOS_PYTHON` (default `python3`),
  `PROCESSOS_PYTHON_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default 20), `PROCESSOS_PYTHON_MAX_OUTPUT` (default
  8000). For the rich path, point `PROCESSOS_PYTHON` at a venv:
  `python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install duckdb pandas numpy scipy` then
  `PROCESSOS_PYTHON=$PWD/.venv/bin/python`.
- `bpmn_model.rs` — **structural BPMN tools** added to the toolbox whenever the process has a
  `model.bpmn`: `read_model` distils the model into a structural graph (process id, start event,
  per-kind counts, and per-node `{id, kind, incoming, outgoing, reachable, gatewayRole}` plus
  kind extras like `jobType`/`attachedTo`/`messageName`), and `analyze_model` returns deterministic
  static findings (missing end events, unreachable / dead-end nodes, exclusive gateways without a
  default flow, unguarded service tasks, parallel-join deadlock hazards, exclusive joins of parallel
  paths, rework loops). Both work with **zero trace data** (design-time review). A flow node's `id`
  and a service task's `job_type` are the same join keys as the trace tables (`jobs.element_id`,
  `jobs.job_type`, `incidents.element_id`), so structural risk can be confirmed against runtime via
  `query_traces`. The **Process Architect** persona is prompted to drive these tools.
- `conformance.rs` — **process-mining tools** that intersect the *designed* model with the
  *actual* trace. `discover_flow` mines the directly-follows graph straight from the `jobs`
  table (task nodes + the A→B transitions between consecutive task executions, ordered by a new
  per-instance `seq` column), with no reference to the BPMN. `conformance_check` replays that
  mined behaviour against the model's permitted task-to-task transitions
  (`bpmn_model::model_task_graph`, which collapses gateways/events so a transition is "permitted"
  when the target task is reachable through only non-task nodes) and reports a transition-fitness
  score plus the concrete divergences: nonconformant transitions, undocumented tasks (executed but
  not modelled), unused model transitions (designed but never taken), and start/end deviations.
  Caveat: parallel branches are linearised in capture, so cross-branch directly-follows edges are
  artefacts. The **Conformance Miner** persona drives both, then characterises the divergences
  with `query_traces`.
- `experiment.rs` — **the Nano Alternate Reality Engine**: speculative execution of variant
  hypotheses. `simulate` forks the current model into a candidate (what-if) BPMN and replays the
  REAL recorded production instances through it on an in-process engine, returning a fidelity
  scorecard (fidelity tier, boundary-conserved count and conserved-rate, replayed latency,
  per-job-type coverage, the job types it would need new workers for, and any output keys it
  failed to reproduce). When a flagged `requiresNewWorkers` / `uncoveredJobTypes` value happens to
  equal a service task's **id**, the scorecard attaches a `jobTypeHints` entry explaining it is the
  `zeebe:taskDefinition`-didn't-bind mistake (the job type defaulted to the element id) — not the
  engine matching on element_id — and points at the `edit_model set_task_job_type` fix, so the model
  stops perceiving it as an engine bug. The scorecard also distinguishes a **genuinely-new worker**
  (a job type with *no* recorded history — the only thing `requiresNewWorkers` now lists, fixable
  with a `mockWorkers` entry) from a **structural divergence**: an *existing* worker (with real
  recorded history) the candidate issued more often than history did. The latter is reported under
  `divergentWorkers` plus a prominent `structuralDivergence` hint that steers the model to fix the
  topology (a broken gateway, a condition on the wrong element, a duplicated branch) instead of
  mocking a real worker. Relatedly, `analyze_model` now emits a `condition-on-non-gateway` warning
  when a flow condition sits on anything other than an exclusive (XOR) gateway — the engine only
  evaluates conditions on a gateway split, so such a condition is silently ignored. `compare_variants` scores a whole *multiverse* of candidates against the
  same recorded dataset — the current model included as the `baseline` — and ranks them
  fidelity-first. Both are built on the deterministic replay harness and need **Tier-2
  recorded-input capture** (`c8 nano --capture` / `NANOBPMN_TRACE_STIMULI`); without it they
  return `replayable:false` with skip accounting rather than fabricating a result. The recorded
  dataset is distilled once per chat turn (bounded to the most recent instances) whenever the
  process has a `model.bpmn`. A new worker can also be mocked as a **failure** — a mock outcome
  with `"throwError": "<ERROR_CODE>"` (instead of `"output"`) makes the worker raise that BPMN
  business error so a candidate's **error boundary** is actually exercised under replay (weight it
  to fail a fraction of the population). The **Experiment Designer** persona drives these tools.
- **Authoring guardrails — runtime errors pulled forward to the authoring boundary.** Hand-writing
  whole-document BPMN is the weakest link for an LLM, so the two highest-frequency mistakes are
  auto-healed and surfaced (IDE-red-squiggle style) instead of looping the model on opaque parse
  errors (`bpmn_model::normalize_authoring` / `lint_task_definition_attribute`): (1) `<…:errorBoundaryEvent>`
  — **not a real BPMN element** — is rewritten to `<…:boundaryEvent>` (an error boundary is a
  `boundaryEvent` carrying a nested `errorEventDefinition`), the single most common cause of the
  `sequence flow … has unknown source element` parse loop; (2) `zeebe:taskDefinition` written as a
  serviceTask **attribute** (which the engine silently ignores, defaulting the job type to the task
  id, so the worker never binds to recorded job types) is flagged as a `task-definition-as-attribute`
  finding with the child-element fix. `validate_model` applies both (reporting them under `autoFixed`
  / findings); `simulate` and `compare_variants` apply the same heal **at the deploy boundary** —
  so the green light is on the same artifact that gets replayed — echoing what changed in
  `authoringFixes`. The opaque engine `deployError` is additionally mapped to a concrete `fix` /
  `fixHint` (`bpmn_model::deploy_fix_hint`) for the recurring boundary-event and unknown-element
  errors. *(Next step on the roadmap: a structured `edit_model` patch tool so the model composes a
  variant from validated operations instead of one-shotting raw XML at all.)*
- **`edit_model` — structured, validated authoring (no more one-shotting raw XML).** The durable
  fix for "hand-writing whole-document BPMN is the LLM's weakest link": instead of emitting raw XML,
  the persona composes a variant from **validated structured operations** applied to the current
  model, and ProcessOS owns the XML correctness end-to-end (`bpmn_model::edit_model` +
  `definition_to_xml`). The base is auto-healed and parsed with the engine's own parser; each op
  mutates the parsed `ProcessDefinition`; the result is re-serialized to engine-parseable XML and
  re-parsed before it is returned — so the model literally **cannot** produce the element/attribute
  syntax mistakes it falls into by hand. Supported ops: `set_task_job_type`, `set_flow_condition`,
  `insert_service_task_after`, `add_error_boundary` (synthesizes the `<bpmn:error>` + `errorRef`
  for you), `reroute_flow`, `remove_node` (reconnects predecessors→successors, drops attached
  boundaries), and `add_exclusive_gateway`. The call returns the new full `model` XML (ready to pass
  straight to `simulate` / `compare_variants`), per-op `appliedOps` notes, and the post-edit
  `analyze_model` findings. The Experiment Designer persona now reaches for `edit_model` as the
  authoring primitive (rung 0 of its iterate-cheaply ladder). *(DI is intentionally omitted — these
  are candidate models for simulation, and the cockpit renders DI-less variants.)*

```bash
# Point the configured LLM at a workspace process bound to a dataset:
curl -XPOST .../api/workspaces/{workspace}/processes/{process}/investigate \
  -d '{"llm":{"model":"local-model"},"maxRounds":12,"allowPython":false}'
# -> { dataset:{instances,jobs,incidents},
#      run:{ answer:"{\"bottleneckJob\":\"credit-check\",\"window\":\"weekday-morning\",…}",
#            steps:[{tool:"query_traces", arguments:{sql}, result}], rounds } }
```

The DuckDB connection is `!Send`, so the endpoint runs the whole loop on a dedicated
current-thread runtime via `spawn_blocking`. The labelled corpus is the **eval substrate**:
`investigate.rs` tests drive the loop over a generated corpus and assert it recovers the
planted `credit-check` / `weekday-morning` fault through the full model→tool→DuckDB→model
path (and via `run_python` over the exported CSV with stdlib-only Python).

### Interactive cockpit chat (`src/chat.rs`, `chat_prompts.rs`)

The one-shot `investigate` call is also available as a **multi-turn, scrollable chat** at
`/cockpit?workspace=&process=`. The operator converses with the droid over the bound
dataset; each turn resumes from the persisted transcript, so the model remembers its own
earlier answers (ask *"where is the bottleneck?"* then *"when does **that** happen?"*).

- `chat.rs` — a file-backed `ChatStore` under `PROCESSOS_DATA_DIR` (one JSON file per
  `(workspace, process)`, holding **several named sessions** so the operator can keep
  multiple parallel investigations) plus `render_view`, which projects the raw model
  transcript into operator-facing `user`/`droid` turns (each droid turn carries the SQL/
  Python tool steps it ran as a collapsible **lab notebook**). Each session has an editable
  `name`, `created`/`updated` stamps, and a per-turn timestamp vector (`stamps`) aligned to
  the rendered turns by `render_view_stamped`. The pre-multisession single-conversation file
  shape is migrated on load into one named session.
- **Sessions / tabs** — the cockpit shows a left-hand tab list (newest activity first) with
  each chat's name and last-message time; operators **create**, **rename**, and **delete**
  sessions, and every chat call carries the active `?session=` id. Endpoints live under
  `.../chat/sessions`.
- **Personas** — each chat session runs under a selectable **persona**: a standing *system*
  prompt that sets the droid's lens and discipline. Built-ins ship with **Performance Analyst**
  (the default — the canonical `investigate::CHAT_SYSTEM`), **SRE / Incident Responder**,
  **Capacity Planner**, **Process Architect**, **Conformance Miner**, and **Experiment Designer**;
  operators author their own in the Prompts view. The persona is chosen in
  the cockpit's compose row, sent as `personaId`, and **baked into the session's system message
  on its first turn** — so a session's persona is fixed once the conversation starts (the picker
  locks and the bound id is surfaced on the session/`SessionMeta`). Personas persist to
  `<config_dir>/personas.json` and are served by `GET/POST /api/personas` + `DELETE
  /api/personas/{id}` (built-ins are read-only). This is distinct from the per-message
  *chat-prompt* templates (`/api/chat-prompts`) and the *hypothesis* system prompts
  (`/api/prompts`).
- `agent::run_agent_resumable` drives the loop over a `&mut Vec<Msg>`, appending the
  assistant/tool turns **and** the final answer so the next turn keeps full context. A turn
  can also be **wrapped up early** (`POST .../chat/wrapup`): the loop checks a per-session
  cancel flag between rounds and, when set (or when the round budget is exhausted), tells the
  model to stop investigating and report its findings so far instead of erroring.
- **Chain-of-thought is preserved across rounds**: the reasoning a model emits in a round
  where it decides to call a tool is folded into a `<think>` block on that tool-calling turn
  and carried forward by `render_view` onto the droid bubble it precedes — so the collapsible
  "Thinking" disclosure survives even when the visible answer came from a later round (the
  cockpit renders it as **collapsed, expandable Markdown**, since models think in Markdown too).
- **Live token streaming** (`POST .../chat/stream`, SSE): the canonical agent loop
  (`run_agent_streaming`) threads a sink that emits `round` / `reasoning` / `answer` / `tool` /
  `toolResult` events as the model produces them, terminated by `done` (or `error`). The
  `OpenAiAgent` requests `stream: true` and parses the SSE deltas — accumulating
  `reasoning_content` and `content` tokens and assembling streamed `tool_calls` fragments by
  index — so the cockpit shows the droid's thinking, tool calls, and answer **as they happen**
  (live "Thinking" disclosure shown open, then collapsed once the turn completes). The
  non-streaming `POST .../chat` endpoint still exists (same loop, no-op sink) for curl/API use.

  non-streaming `POST .../chat` endpoint still exists (same loop, no-op sink) for curl/API use.
- **Pair AI — a second model reviews each turn (N-tier ready).** Optionally, after the primary
  droid answers, one or more **Pair AI** reviewers run in sequence, each a *fresh* sub-conversation
  (its own LLM profile + a **pair-kind persona**) that is handed the user's question and the prior
  answer and re-runs over the **same** data/model tools (`query_traces`, `validate_model`,
  `simulate`, …) to verify, refine, or challenge it. Built-in pair personas: **Skeptic / Red-Team**
  (the default — stress-tests the conclusion), **Synthesizer** (reconciles into one answer), and
  **Refiner** (tightens and corrects). Only the reviewer's final answer is appended to the
  transcript — marked so `render_view` surfaces it as an attributed `pair` turn (purple bubble,
  "🤝 Pair AI · {name}") — keeping the thread a single coherent conversation. The orchestration
  lives in `investigate::run_chat_turn`, which accepts a **chain** of `PairStage`s (`pairs:
  Vec<PairRequest>`; the convenience `pair` field is a 1-stage chain), emitting an `agent`
  SSE/provenance boundary before each reviewer — so the design generalises from one reviewer to an
  N-tier network of cooperating agents. Pair AI is **off by default**; enable it in the compose row,
  pick the reviewer's profile (ideally a *different* model family, so errors decorrelate) and
  persona. Pair personas carry `kind: "pair"` and are offered only in the Pair AI picker, never as
  the primary chat persona. A **carry-forward** button (↪) on any droid/pair answer quotes it into
  the composer, so you can also hand one model's conclusion to another model on the next turn
  (cross-provider refinement) without enabling synchronous Pair AI.
- **Loop monitor — a second model breaks circling (`src/monitor.rs`).** A long investigation can
  *semantically* circle — rephrasing the same dead-end, oscillating between hypotheses, or
  re-attacking a genuinely unreachable path — which the cheap lexical guards in `agent.rs`
  (identical-line / identical-tool-call repetition) don't catch. Optionally enable a **loop
  monitor**: an async watcher that periodically reads the live transcript (made fresh by the
  ~2s incremental persistence), renders a recent window, and asks a *second* model (its own
  profile + a `kind: "monitor"` persona, the built-in **Loop Breaker**) whether the primary is
  circling. If so it injects a `[loop monitor] …` **steer** into the same queue the human
  Steer button uses — primed with the escape hatches (mock workers, failure mocking,
  `edit_model`) so it nudges toward forward progress. After a bounded steer budget
  (`MONITOR_MAX_STEERS`, default 3) of continued circling it escalates to a forced **wrap-up**
  (the same cancel path as the human Wrap-up button). It's **off by default** and biased to
  false negatives (any transport/parse failure ⇒ "not circling" ⇒ no intervention). The
  watcher emits `{type:"monitor"}` SSE events, rendered as a distinct centered note in the
  thread. Enable per-request (`monitor:{enabled, profileId, personaId}`) or globally via the
  `PROCESSOS_MONITOR` env var (`1`/`profileId` ⇒ on). In the cockpit it's a **Monitor** toggle in
  the compose row (a second "pairing mode" alongside Pair AI); its profile picker defaults to the
  local **sidecar** model so it's cheap to keep watching.
- `chat_prompts.rs` — a **prompt library** of reusable compose-box message templates,
  persisted to the user **config dir** (`chat-prompts.json`, alongside `settings.json`).
  Ships four built-ins led by an **open investigation** (the default, pre-loaded into a
  fresh compose box so the unbiased default action is to let the droid profile the data and
  find the problem itself) plus a specific *worker-swap hypothesis*, a temporal angle, and a
  failures angle. Operators author new ones from the compose box ("Save prompt") or the
  console **Prompts** view (which lists both libraries), and load any into the box from a
  dropdown. The CHAT_SYSTEM framing is deliberately open — it asks the analyst to profile
  broadly and form its own hypotheses rather than confirm a preconceived answer — and the
  process's operator-set **objective** (editable on the cockpit surface) is woven in as
  *background context, not a conclusion*, so the operator can optionally steer without
  pre-revealing the planted issue.

```

The chat surface adds a few operator conveniences: a left-hand **tab list** of named chat
sessions (each showing its last-message time and turn count) with **+ New**, inline
**rename** (✎), and **delete** (✕); every message and the tab itself is **timestamped**. Each
chat window also has a **Chat / Debug** tab pair — the **Debug** tab shows *exactly what was
sent to the model* on the session's most recent turn (`GET .../chat/sessions/{id}/debug`): one
collapsible section per round with the model, temperature, `max_tokens`, the **full message
array** (system prompt + prior transcript + the latest message, each role-badged), the tool
specs offered, and a **Copy JSON payload** button — so it's clear the model receives far more
than just the operator's prompt. (The same payloads stream live as `request` SSE events.) The
**Send** button is a split control labelled with the active LLM profile (*"Investigate with
&lt;profile&gt; →"*) whose **caret opens a profile picker** so the operator can switch the model
that answers the next message without opening Settings; the button relabels live when the
active profile changes. Droid bubbles are titled with the **profile name** and the model id in
a smaller, dimmer parenthetical (*"Remote Qwen 3.6 (unsloth/qwen3.6-…)"*); they carry a
**copy-to-clipboard** button and render the answer as **Markdown** (headings, lists,
bold/italic, inline + fenced code, **GitHub-style tables**, links — escaped first, only http(s)
links emitted). Any reasoning is shown as a **collapsed, expandable, Markdown** "Thinking"
disclosure whose **tool calls appear inline, exactly where they happened** in the chain of
thought (each its own nested collapsible section). The droid's chain-of-thought is captured
whether the backend emits inline `<think>…</think>` tags or a separate `reasoning_content`
field (as llama.cpp does for Gemma/Qwen), and is preserved even when it happened in an earlier
tool-calling round.
**A−/A+** controls size the chat font (persisted in `localStorage`); a **Wrap it up →** button
appears while a turn is in flight (`POST .../chat/wrapup`); and the Python toggle
self-describes from `GET /api/python/status` — *"Enable Python Data Science tools"* when the
interpreter has pandas/duckdb, *"Enable Python (Optional: Install Data Science tools)"* with an
install popup when it runs but lacks them, or *"Configure Python"* with a setup popup when no
interpreter is usable — and its on/off state is **persisted** in `localStorage`.


## The cockpit & pilot loop (§10)

The optimization loop is itself authored as **editable BPMN** (the *pilot process*,
`pilot/pilot-self-optimize.bpmn`) deployed on the own engine — its **user tasks** are
the human's turns, **LLM tasks** the droid's, **engine tasks** the craft responding.
The pilot is **forkable** and file-backed under the data dir (`src/pilot.rs`), so the
delegation boundary an operator encodes in it is durable and inspectable. The
**cockpit** (`/cockpit`, `src/cockpit.rs` + `conversation.rs`) wraps the experiment
stepper in a persisted droid-conversation surface.

## Run

### Prerequisites (machine setup)

- **Rust** (stable) — `cargo` builds/tests; the `duckdb` crate vendors its engine (bundled),
  so no system DuckDB is needed. First build compiles the bundled amalgamation (~95s, one-time).
- **Python 3** — only required for the optional `run_python` investigation tool. A bare
  `python3` works (stdlib fallback). For the **rich** analysis path (pandas/numpy/scipy/duckdb)
  create a venv once and point `PROCESSOS_PYTHON` at it:

  ```sh
  # from the processos/ directory
  python3 -m venv .venv
  .venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
  .venv/bin/pip install duckdb pandas numpy scipy
  export PROCESSOS_PYTHON="$PWD/.venv/bin/python"   # else run_python uses stdlib-only python3
  ```

  The `.venv/` is git-ignored and machine-local. Without it, `run_python` still runs but the
  preamble degrades to stdlib `csv` row-dicts (`HAVE_PANDAS`/`HAVE_DUCKDB` are `False`).

```sh
# Build + test
make processos-build
make processos-test

# Run against a Nano gateway (defaults shown)
PROCESSOS_PORT=8090 NANO_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 cargo run

# …or let ProcessOS spawn + supervise its own engine for the pilot loop
PROCESSOS_SPAWN_NANO=1 cargo run
```

| `PROCESSOS_DATA_DIR` | `./.processos-data` | Persisted forks, conversations, prefs |
| `PROCESSOS_WORKSPACES_DIR` | _(`<data_dir>/workspaces`)_ | Root of the workspaces/processes tree |

| `PROCESSOS_NANO_PORT` | `0` (auto) | Port for the spawned own engine |
| `PROCESSOS_NANO_DATA_DIR` | `.processos-nano-data` | Data dir for the spawned own engine |
| `PROCESSOS_NANO_CAPTURE` | `true` | Enable trace/stimulus capture on the own engine |
| `PROCESSOS_PYTHON` | `python3` | Interpreter for the `run_python` tool — point at a venv for the rich (pandas/duckdb) path |
| `PROCESSOS_PYTHON_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `20` | Wall-clock budget for a `run_python` call (child killed past it) |
| `PROCESSOS_PYTHON_MAX_OUTPUT` | `8000` | Max chars of combined stdout+stderr returned to the model |

### Capturing replay inputs on Nano (opt-in, on the engine being read)

Recorded-input replay needs the real inputs on the trace. These are **off by default**
(footprint + PII) and enabled on the *Nano* side:

- `NANOBPMN_TRACE_VARIABLES` — retain creation inputs + per-incident variable snapshots
  (`NANOBPMN_TRACE_VARIABLES_MAX_BYTES`, default 16384, caps each snapshot).
- `NANOBPMN_TRACE_STIMULI` — also retain the ordered external-stimulus log per instance
  (implies variable capture; `NANOBPMN_TRACE_STIMULI_MAX`, default 1024, caps the log).

When ProcessOS spawns its own engine with capture on, it sets `NANOBPMN_TRACE_STIMULI`
for it automatically.
