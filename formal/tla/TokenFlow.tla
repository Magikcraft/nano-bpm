(* Token flow of a single nanobpm process instance in a single scope.      *)

(*   - A command enqueues `Step::Activate` work; the engine drains the     *)
(*     queue to empty before the command settles. `pending` is that queue, *)
(*     held as a bag of the sequence flows being taken: the engine drains  *)
(*     FIFO, but the model lets any pending step go next. That covers every*)
(*     FIFO order, so a safety property proved here also holds for FIFO.   *)
(*   - Tasks are wait states: activation parks a token in `waiting` until  *)
(*     an external `CompleteTask` command (a job completion).              *)
(*   - A parallel gateway with >1 incoming flow is a join                  *)
(*     (`activate_join`). As in Zeebe, a flow into a join is counted when  *)
(*     it is taken (`ParallelJoinTokenArrived`, `join_flow_arrivals`);     *)
(*     the join opens when an arrival cannot fire it                       *)
(*     (`ParallelJoinOpened`). It fires once every incoming flow holds a   *)
(*     token, consuming one token per flow and keeping the surplus         *)
(*     (`ParallelJoinFired`, Zeebe's "Tetris" principle). A surplus        *)
(*     reopens the join, so it stays live (#1233).                         *)
(*   - An inclusive gateway with >1 incoming flow is a join too, with the  *)
(*     same bookkeeping. As in Zeebe, readiness is decided only when a     *)
(*     token arrives (#1241): the join fires if every incoming flow holds  *)
(*     a token, or if some flow holds one and no live source (a waiting    *)
(*     task, another open join, or a queued activation) can reach it       *)
(*     without crossing a flow that already holds a token                  *)
(*     (`has_active_path_to`). It is never re-evaluated otherwise, so a    *)
(*     join whose remaining path diverged elsewhere, or a surplus with no  *)
(*     partner, waits forever, as in Zeebe.                                *)
(*   - Conditions are abstracted: an exclusive gateway takes some single   *)
(*     outgoing flow, an inclusive split or join takes some non-empty      *)
(*     subset (condition/incident paths are out of scope for this slice). *)
(*   - An instance completes once it settles with no live tokens           *)
(*     (`complete_finished_instances`).                                    *)

Settled == Quiescent

\* The elements one step from `n` over its outgoing flows outside `blocked`.
Succ(n, blocked) == {Tgt[g] : g \in Out(n) \ blocked}

\* Mirrors `path_reaches_join`: `j` is reachable from `src` over sequence flows
\* other than those in `blocked` (the join's incoming flows that already hold
\* a token, Zeebe's `hasActivePathToTheGateway`). Each round names the
\* previous one exactly once: TLC does not cache that value inside the ENABLED
\* checks that fairness needs, so a second reference would make the cost

LiveSources ==

    LET blocked == {g \in In(j) : arr[g] > 0}
    IN  \E m \in LiveSources \ {j} : PathReaches(m, j, blocked)

\* The single canonical Nano join-firing guard, as a function of a join `j` and
\* its per-flow arrivals `arr`. `ArriveJoin` fires exactly on this predicate and
\* `RefinesZeebe` compares exactly this predicate to Zeebe: routing both the
\* action guard and the refinement obligation through ONE definition is what
\* makes `RefinesZeebe` a genuine constraint on the action — an edit to the guard
\* changes both sides at once, so the invariant cannot silently pass over drift.
\* A parallel join fires once every incoming flow holds a token; an inclusive
\* join also fires when some flow holds a token and no live source can reach it.

\* Mirrors `activate_join`, which guards both join kinds. The arriving token was
\* already counted when its flow was taken. A parallel join fires once every
\* incoming flow holds a token (`canActivateParallelGateway`). An inclusive
\* join also fires when some flow holds a token and no live source can reach
\* it (`canActivateInclusiveGateway`). On firing it routes to the chosen subset
\* `S`; each incoming flow holding a token gives up one, including tokens whose
\* activation is still queued (that activation later finds nothing to do), and
\* a surplus reopens the join. A rejected arrival opens the join if it holds a
\* token. `premature` re-checks the parallel guard.

\* The routing choices available when an activation of `n` completes: an

\* Fairness, exactly as stated in `Fairness` below:
\*   - SF on each `DrainVia(f, S)`. Each
\*     routing choice S is its own action, so strong fairness means a gateway
\*     reached infinitely often eventually takes each of its branches. This is
\*     the "fair data" assumption of workflow-net soundness, and it lets a loop
\*     with an exit terminate. Conditions are abstracted, so this states what a
\*     graph *allows*, not that particular data exits a loop.
\*   - SF on each `CompleteTask(t)`: a task can only complete in a settled
\*     state, so it can be enabled intermittently while other work drains.
\*   - WF on `CompleteInstance`: once enabled, it stays enabled.
\* (Fairness on Next as a whole would only guarantee that *some* step happens,
\* so one task could starve.)

(* Properties *)

\* Join bookkeeping stays coherent (the class behind the missing
\* `ParallelJoinReset` bugs): an open join holds tokens, a join holding tokens
\* is open unless an activation into it is still queued (flows are counted
\* when taken), tokens only sit on a join's own incoming flows, only joins are
\* ever open, and a parallel join never has every incoming flow fed without an
\* activation on its way to fire it.
InTransitTo(n) == \E g \in In(n) : pending[g] > 0

    /\ \A n \in Nodes : joinOpen[n] => \E g \in Flows : joinTokens[n][g] > 0

    /\ \A n \in Nodes : \A g \in Flows \ In(n) : joinTokens[n][g] = 0
    /\ \A n \in Nodes \ (ParJoins \cup IncJoins) : ~joinOpen[n]
    /\ \A j \in ParJoins : (\A g \in In(j) : joinTokens[j][g] > 0) => InTransitTo(j)

\* BPMN / Zeebe parity: a parallel join activates only once *every* incoming
\* sequence flow has been taken (Zeebe counts distinct taken flows,
\* `ProcessInstanceStateTransitionGuard.canActivateParallelGateway`).
ParallelJoinWaitsForEveryFlow == premature = {}

\* Once a settled instance has no task left that could drive it on, no join may
\* still be open. Otherwise the instance can never complete: it is stuck
\* forever on a join that no token will ever reach.
NoStuckInstance ==
    (Settled /\ ~completed /\ \A t \in Tasks : waiting[t] = 0)
        => \A n \in Nodes : ~joinOpen[n]

\* Whether the process graph has no cycle. This is derived from the graph, never
\* declared, so a model cannot be mislabelled and silently skip the property
\* below.
Acyclic == \A n \in Nodes : n \notin Reaching(n)

\* Without cycles, every join fires at most once per instance. A rework loop
\* legitimately re-fires a join. Acyclicity alone does not rule out a second
\* firing: an acyclic graph that routes several tokens onto one join's inputs
\* (a parallel split whose branches merge through an exclusive gateway, as in
\* MCParallelJoinSurplus and MCInclusiveJoinSurplus) can fire it again on the surplus tokens. That is
\* intended: such a graph is not 1-safe, a BPMN lack-of-synchronization, and
\* this invariant is how the checker reports it. Record such a model as an
\* expected violation only when it deliberately reproduces an engine defect or
\* an unsound graph (see check.sh).
JoinFiresAtMostOnce == Acyclic => \A j \in ParJoins \cup IncJoins : fireCount[j] <= 1

\* Every instance eventually completes, under the fairness above.
