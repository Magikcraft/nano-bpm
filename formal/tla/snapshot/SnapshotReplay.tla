(* Derived predicates over the durable world.                              *)
(***************************************************************************)

\* A present snapshot this build can actually load: its format_version is not
\* newer than we support and its payload still deserializes (load_latest_snapshot
\* + check_format_version). A newer version or a corrupt payload is the typed
\* SnapshotLoadError that routes to replay-migration.
SnapReadable == snapPresent /\ (snapVersion <= CurVersion) /\ (~snapCorrupt)

\* Readability is meaningful only for a NON-empty region: an empty hot tail
\* (total = firstIndex) or empty cold archive (coldEnd = 0) trivially "decodes",
\* so a stray `hotOk`/`coldOk` = FALSE on an empty region is ignored. (This lets
\* a damaged event be compacted out of the hot tail into the cold store without
\* the model tracking which physical region each byte lives in.)
HotReadable == (total = firstIndex) \/ hotOk
ColdReadable == (coldEnd = 0) \/ coldOk

\* A readable snapshot that sits BELOW the compaction floor: it covers less than
\* the surviving journal starts at, so trusting it drops the compacted window
\* [snapCovered, firstIndex) and rewinds the key generator. `recover` rejects it
\* loud rather than migrating (the distinct #1065 stale-snapshot signal).
SnapStale == SnapReadable /\ (firstIndex > 0) /\ (snapCovered < firstIndex)

\* The contiguous-from-0 history length produced by stitching a base covering
\* [0, base) with the hot tail [firstIndex, total). They join into the full
\* [0, total) only when the base reaches the floor; otherwise the gap at `base`
\* truncates the reconstructed prefix there.
Contig(base) == IF base >= firstIndex THEN total ELSE base

\* A recovery outcome is a typed record: `reject` = TRUE means recovery refused
\* (failed closed); otherwise `len` is the contiguous-from-0 history length it
\* reconstructed. (A record keeps the two safety invariants fully typed — TLC
\* refuses to compare a string sentinel with an integer length.)
Reject == [reject |-> TRUE, len |-> 0]
Rebuilt(k) == [reject |-> FALSE, len |-> k]

\* The shipped, fail-closed recovery (seglog::recover). Mirrors its branches:
\*   - an unreadable hot tail errors up front (#1070);
\*   - a stale-below-floor readable snapshot fails loud (#1065);
\*   - a readable, non-stale snapshot: snapshot base + replayed tail;
\*   - no snapshot with the hot log still rooted at 0: replay the whole tail;
\*   - otherwise migrate-by-replay: the cold prefix + hot tail, but ONLY when
\*     the validated cold prefix meets the floor (coldEnd = firstIndex) and
\*     decodes; any gap or undecodable frame fails closed (#1066).
CorrectOutcome ==
  IF ~HotReadable THEN Reject
  ELSE IF SnapStale THEN Reject
  ELSE IF SnapReadable THEN Rebuilt(Contig(snapCovered))
  ELSE IF (~snapPresent /\ firstIndex = 0) THEN Rebuilt(Contig(0))
  ELSE IF (coldEnd = firstIndex /\ ColdReadable) THEN Rebuilt(Contig(coldEnd))
  ELSE Reject

\* The historical pre-#1066 recovery: it silently stitched whatever base was
\* present (a stale snapshot, or the surviving tail atop nothing) and never
\* failed closed. `.ok()?`-swallowing an unreadable snapshot dropped it to the
\* cold/tail base; no floor check let a stale snapshot through; no gap check let
\* a compacted-away prefix rewind.
NaiveBase == IF SnapReadable THEN snapCovered ELSE coldEnd
NaiveOutcome == IF ~HotReadable THEN Reject ELSE Rebuilt(Contig(NaiveBase))

RecoverOutcome == IF FailClosedRecovery THEN CorrectOutcome ELSE NaiveOutcome

\* Ground truth (independent of the recovery under test): the furthest a usable,
\* readable base reaches from 0. A stale/inconsistent snapshot is NOT a usable
\* base (recovery must not trust it); the cold prefix is usable only when it
\* decodes.
UsableBase ==
  IF SnapReadable /\ ~SnapStale THEN snapCovered
  ELSE IF ColdReadable THEN coldEnd
  ELSE 0

\* The full [0, total) history is genuinely reconstructable iff the hot tail
\* decodes AND a readable base reaches the floor (or the hot log still starts
\* at 0, so the tail alone is the whole history).
CanReconstructFull == HotReadable /\ (firstIndex = 0 \/ UsableBase >= firstIndex)

(***************************************************************************)

\* #1065: recovery either rejects, or reconstructs the FULL history. It never
\* silently rebuilds a strictly-older (shorter) prefix.
NoSilentRewind == RecoverOutcome.reject \/ (RecoverOutcome.len = total)

\* #1066: when the full history cannot be reconstructed, recovery rejects rather
\* than proceeding on a partial history.
