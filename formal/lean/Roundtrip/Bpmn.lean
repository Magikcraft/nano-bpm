# `Roundtrip.Bpmn` — the BPMN projection and its inverse

The other lossless projection of an engine element is BPMN XML
(`processos/src/bpmn_model.rs`). Where the IR names a kind with a single
keyword, BPMN names it *structurally*: a generic element `localName` (many kinds
share one, e.g. every boundary event is `<boundaryEvent>`, every timed catch is
`<intermediateCatchEvent>`) **disambiguated by a child event definition**
(`<timerEventDefinition>`, `<errorEventDefinition>`, …) and a couple of
degenerate cases (a terminate end is `<endEvent>` + `<terminateEventDefinition>`).

This module models that projection as `toBpmn : Kind → BpmnShape` and its
inverse `fromBpmn : BpmnShape → Option Kind`, and proves the inverse *is* a left
inverse on the supported set (`fromBpmn_toBpmn`). That theorem is the crux of the
round-trip: it certifies that the `(localName, eventDefinition)` pair BPMN uses
is a faithful (injective) re-encoding of the IR keyword, so no element kind
collapses into another when it crosses to BPMN and back.
