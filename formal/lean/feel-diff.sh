# formal job builds engine-core here without it). When mold is absent the link
# dies with `collect2: fatal error: cannot find 'ld'`, so drop that flag for this
# build and use rustc's bundled, self-contained lld (its default linker on
# x86_64-linux) instead — no system-linker dependency. A non-empty RUSTFLAGS
# outranks and fully replaces the target-scoped config rustflags (an empty value
# is ignored by cargo, so it must carry the lld flag). Only done on Linux without
# mold, so dev machines and the mold-provisioned Rust CI jobs keep the speedup.
