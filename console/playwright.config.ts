// Playwright config for the guided-journey e2e guards (ADR 0049, #417) and the
// mobile-first console guards (issue #1005, unit A7).
//
// Scoped deliberately narrowly: the desktop journey suite exists to catch the
// class of breakage no other gate can see — a journey step pointing at a
// `data-tour` anchor that has been renamed or deleted. Nothing in a normal build
// or unit test fails when that happens; the step just silently spotlights nothing.
//
// The mobile suite (`e2e/mobile/`) is the compensating control for the same class
// of problem one layer up: the mobile-first views (A1–A6) branch their entire
// presentation on `useIsNarrow()`, and nothing in a build or unit test proves the
// card home, the hamburger sheet, the Explorer list→detail flow, the instance
// drill-in cards, the app UI/Logs cards or the `?instance=` deep-link actually
// render — and stay free of horizontal overflow — at a phone viewport. Only a
// browser sized to a phone can.
//
// The suite never talks to a real gateway. Every test stubs the console API, so a
// run is deterministic and needs no engine, no Deno, and no scaffolded project —
// which is what keeps it honest under this repo's no-intermittent-failures,
// no-retries rule.
