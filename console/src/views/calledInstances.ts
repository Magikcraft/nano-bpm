// Pure helpers for the InstanceDetail parent->child "Called Process Instances"
// slice (see InstanceDetail.tsx).
//
// A parent instance's `called_instances` (the snake_case wire field from #1115)
// lists the child process instances it spawned through its call activities. Each
// entry names the call-activity cell (`calling_element_id`) that spawned it,
// resolved from the child's `parent_element_instance_key`. This module holds the
// side-effect-free decisions that back two behaviours, so the console's
// node:test unit suite can cover them directly (the component itself only runs
// in a browser):
//
//   1. Rendering the "Called Process Instances" table (`groupCalledInstances`).
//   2. Resolving what a click on a diagram call-activity cell should do,
//      matching Camunda Operate (`resolveCallActivitySelection`): a single child
//      navigates straight to it; a multi-instance call activity reveals its
//      children ("View all"); a call activity that has not spawned yet shows a
//      "no called instance" affordance; a non-call-activity element is ignored.
//
// `calling_element_id` matching is the single source of truth for "which child
// belongs to which cell", so both the table grouping and the click resolution
// route through it.
