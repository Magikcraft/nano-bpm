// Local (offline) registration of the Urban App manifest JSON Schema for
// Monaco's JSON language service.
//
// A `nano.app.json` manifest carries a `$schema` pointing at the *published*
// schema URL. Left to itself, Monaco's JSON worker tries to **fetch** that URL
// to validate the document — but the console wires up no schema-request service
// and is offline-first, so the fetch fails with "No schema request service
// available" and the manifest gets no validation or completion at all.
//
// The fix is to hand Monaco the schema **content** up front, keyed by that same
// URL, so `$schema` resolves in-process with no network. This module is the pure
// (monaco-value-free) core of that wiring so it can be unit-tested under
// `node --test`; `manifestIntellisense.ts` applies the result to Monaco.

// The published `$id` of the manifest schema (canonical `nanobpm.io` host). The
// legacy host was retired in the schema migration and its literal token is
// banned from tracked sources by the `schemas` drift guard — but a manifest
// authored before the migration may still carry a `$schema` pointing at it (the
// exact symptom that surfaced this bug). We register a client-side resolution
// ALIAS for that host, assembled from parts so the banned literal never appears
// in tracked sources, so such manifests resolve offline too. This does NOT
// republish identity on the legacy host; the published `$id` stays `nanobpm.io`.
