 * Explorer (see {@link ../components/IncidentReason}).
 *
 * An incident reason is whatever the worker/engine emitted — often a full,
 * multiline stderr dump (a failing `git clone`, an agent-harness traceback).
 * The console must render that text **faithfully**: preserved line breaks, no
 * lossy truncation. Any "collapsing" is purely *visual* (a CSS line clamp with
 * an expand toggle); the full string is always kept for expand + copy.
 *
 * The decision of *whether* to offer the expand/collapse affordance is the one
 * bit of logic worth testing in isolation, so it lives here — dependency-free —
 * rather than being tangled into the component.
