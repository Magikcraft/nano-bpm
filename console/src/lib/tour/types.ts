// The guided-journey contract (ADR 0049).
//
// A *journey* is a short, outcome-shaped onboarding path: at most five steps
// that leave a real result behind (a project that ran, an instance that
// completed, a served page that answered) rather than a set of tooltips naming
// tabs. Journeys replace the profile-keyed step list the tour spike shipped,
// because the build profile is NOT the persona: `studio` and `observe` are a
// build-time split, while the users who matter most all land in the *same*
// studio build wanting materially different first sessions.
//
// Everything here is deliberately data, not behaviour, with one exception:
// preconditions and success predicates are functions over a `TourContext`
// snapshot. That is what lets a step ask "would this action actually work?"
// instead of promising something the console already knows it cannot deliver.
//
// Type-only imports throughout: this module must stay free of runtime imports
// so `../profile` (which reads the Vite-injected `__STUDIO__` global at import
// time) is never pulled into a Node unit test.
