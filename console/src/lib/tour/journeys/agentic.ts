// The agentic-SDLC journeys — "orchestrate a coding-agent harness" (ADR 0049 §6,
// journeys 0a/0b; ADR 0046 agent-as-worker).
//
// These are the two journeys that make Nano's actual pitch concrete: you author a
// *durable* multi-round loop around an external coding-agent harness — the agent
// does the work, the engine owns the waiting — then you hire a harness against it
// and watch an instance park on a real, engine-visible human-approval catch event.
//
// The split is deliberate and load-bearing. ADR 0049 caps a journey at five steps
// and forbids padding a detour into one, so the single "close the agentic loop"
// story is two journeys divided exactly at the terminal boundary:
//
//   - 0a `agentic-author` — five steps, entirely in the console: scaffold the
//     Code-first workflow template, read its three verbs, see the BPMN the engine
//     DERIVED from that code (the differentiator over code-only durable-execution
//     engines), and Run it into a deployed, polling worker host.
//   - 0b `agentic-hire` — three steps spanning the console AND the terminal:
//     hire a harness against the job type the `w.task` step emits, start an
//     instance, watch it reach the agent step and park on the human signal, then
//     resume it to completion and hand off to the full reference app.
//
// Studio-only: both operate on a project workspace (author, model, run), which
// the observe build strips entirely (ADR 0034). Node-safety: the only runtime
// imports at module scope are the pure registry/anchors/precondition helpers; the
// browser-only API client (`../../gen`, `../../lib/api`) is reached through a
// dynamic `import()` INSIDE the context source, so importing this file to register
// its journeys — as the guard tests do — never drags an `EventSource`/fetch client
// into Node.
