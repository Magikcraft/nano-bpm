// Journey 2 — 90-second RAD fullstack prototype (an Urban app). ADR 0049 §6.
//
// The most console-native journey, and the one that makes ADR 0022's thesis
// tangible: *the binding is the product*. Delphi (ADR 0022's lineage — Adam
// Urban, Turbo Pascal onwards) turned a business problem into a running program
// in an afternoon by unifying a form painter, an event model, data-aware
// controls and a native compiler into one loop — drop a control, write the
// handler, ship a single `.exe`. Urban is that loop for a process app: one
// project holds the process, the screen, the app's own data and the code, and
// it compiles to a single binary that runs with no external server.
//
// So this journey walks a *fullstack* prototype end to end in five steps:
// pick the Urban App template, see the four parts of a fullstack app in the file
// tree, edit a screen without writing a frontend (the Page Composer — ADR 0042,
// the Delphi Form Designer), Run it into a working served app, and see in the
// Explorer the instance that the served UI started.
//
// Import-safe for the Node journey guards: only `registerJourney` /
// `registerContextSource` (pure map/set adds) run at module top level. Everything
// that reads `window` or the network lives inside a function body, invoked only
// in the browser.
