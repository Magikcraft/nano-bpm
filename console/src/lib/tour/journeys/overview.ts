// The overview journeys — "just show me around".
//
// This is the spike's original tour, ported onto the journey contract and
// deliberately DEMOTED. ADR 0049's finding is that an orientation tour naming
// the tabs serves none of the three target users, so it is no longer what a
// first-timer gets by default: it becomes the zero-commitment fallback for
// someone who does not want to pick a journey, offered alongside the real ones
// in the picker (#411) and behind the rail's "Take a tour" button.
//
// It is also the one journey with no outcome — see `successEvent` below. That is
// precisely why it is the fallback and not the default.

 * orientation tour look like an accomplishment.
