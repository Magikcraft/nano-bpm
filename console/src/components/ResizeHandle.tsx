/**
 * The draggable divider for a {@link usePaneResize} pane. Spread the hook's
 * result plus the resize `axis`; the handle renders a thin hit-target that
 * widens/brightens on hover and while dragging, shows the correct resize
 * cursor, and exposes an accessible `separator` role with keyboard support
 * (arrow keys nudge the pane).
 *
 * `label` names what the handle resizes (for screen readers). It is absolutely
 * positioned over the seam between the two panes, so its parent flex/column
 * child (the pane it follows) must be `relative` OR the handle can sit as its
 * own flex child — here it is a normal flex child with negative margin so it
 * overlaps the 1px border seam without shifting layout.
