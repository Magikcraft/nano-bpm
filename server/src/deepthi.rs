//! # Deepthi — the single-writer engine actor
//!
//! A single-writer command actor that owns the durable [`Journal`].
//!
//! Named for **Deepthi Akkoorath**, whose work on concurrency and distributed
//! consensus — including a randomized simulation framework for reliably
//! reproducing concurrent-interaction bugs in the core consensus algorithm — is
//! the inspiration for this subsystem. The actor model here descends from Erlang:
//! a single owner, a serial mailbox, and isolation instead of shared-memory
//! locks. Artists sign their work.
//!
//! The engine is a single writer, so every mutation must be serialized. The
//! previous design wrapped the [`Journal`] in a `std::sync::RwLock` shared across
//! all request tasks. That is an anti-pattern under an async runtime: a blocking
//! `std` lock contended by many tasks *parks the tokio worker thread* holding it
//! instead of yielding, so a burst of concurrent commands stalls the whole
//! runtime — measured here as a 240× collapse in per-request latency from only a
//! handful of concurrent producers.
//!
//! Instead, the [`Journal`] lives on one dedicated thread and commands reach it
//! through an `mpsc` channel; callers `await` a one-shot reply. This mirrors
//! Zeebe's per-partition `StreamProcessor` actor: a single owner, a serial
//! command queue, and tokio workers that only ever park on an async `await`
//! (never on a blocking lock). Serde-heavy request decode / response encode is
//! done by the caller *around* [`DeepthiHandle::with`], so the 50 KB variable
//! payloads are converted in parallel across cores rather than serially on the
//! engine thread.
