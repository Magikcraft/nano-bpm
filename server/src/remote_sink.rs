//! Remote read-model projection sinks (pluggable-exporter epic, issue #133, M2).
//!
//! Two sinks are provided on top of the [`ProjectionSink`] seam:
//!
//! * [`RemoteSink`] — computes the engine-facing [`ExportOutcome`] from a tiny
//!   in-RAM in-flight index (no disk), ships the batch's events to a central
//!   exporter over a [`BatchTransport`], and advances only the local shard's
//!   compaction watermark. This is the "decoupled disk IOPS / data-lake" mode:
//!   the heavy projection (instances, variables, jobs) leaves the node entirely.
//! * [`TeeSink`] — projects to a local (authoritative) sink AND mirrors the same
//!   batch to a remote sink. The local outcome is returned, so in-flight
//!   accounting, queries, and the compaction watermark stay exactly as today
//!   while a durable copy is streamed downstream. The safe intermediate.
//!
//! The projection contract (idempotent, never-drop-a-batch, per-shard order) is
//! documented on [`ProjectionSink`]; both sinks uphold it. Remote **delivery**
//! is currently best-effort with respect to durability: the watermark advances
//! once a batch is enqueued for the transport, not once the remote target has
//! acknowledged it. Ack-gated advancement is a later milestone (#133).
