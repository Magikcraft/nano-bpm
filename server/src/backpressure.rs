//! Three modes, selected by `NANOBPMN_BACKPRESSURE_MAX_INFLIGHT`:
//! - **Adaptive** (default; unset / `auto` / `adaptive`): an AIMD concurrency

//!   congestion threshold is derived from a *measured* baseline latency rather
//!   than a hard-coded timeout, so it adapts to the host with no magic constant.
//! - **Fixed(n)** (a positive integer): a static in-flight-instance watermark.
//! - **Disabled** (`0` / `off` / `none` / `false` / `disabled`): never shed.
//!
//! In every mode the quantity compared against the limit is the count of
//! in-flight (Active, non-terminal) process instances, tracked by the read-model

/// The standalone admission-backlog **compressor**, stepped once per ~1 Hz monitor
/// tick (not on the engine actor loop). It bounds the admission-backlog cap by
/// reacting to **engine-actor saturation ρ** (the busy fraction of the single-writer
/// engine actor) paired with the **runnable-backlog growth rate** — the two signals
/// that together answer the operator's real question: *are we falling behind
/// (backlog rising) AND is it our fault (the engine actor is saturated)?*
///
/// ## Why ρ + backlog-trend, not latency-over-baseline
/// A latency-over-learned-baseline compressor (the prior design) needs a
/// *healthy-busy* reference it cannot learn from a cold start or a busy-storm
/// wake-up, and its baseline pinned to the idle floor, clamping perpetually. ρ has
/// none of those problems:
/// - **absolute** — ρ ∈ [0,1] needs no learning and no magic latency number, so it
///   is correct on the very first window (cold-start-proof);
/// - **captures disk *and* CPU** — the fsync is inside the timed `job(journal)`
///   region, so a disk-bound actor reads ρ≈1 just like a CPU-bound one;
/// - **immune to external strain** — a slow downstream/worker makes the actor *park*
///   waiting for work (ρ low), so it never mistakes someone else's outage for our
///   own saturation and never throttles admission for it.
///
/// ρ alone cannot tell a healthy peak (a work-conserving server saturates at ρ≈1
/// serving a load it *is* keeping up with) from genuine overload, so it is paired
/// with backlog growth: **we are the bottleneck only when ρ is high AND the backlog
/// is rising.** (Sojourn is retained purely as a per-job-type *reporting* surface.)
///
/// ## Compressor control law (three-zone, crisp + one proportional touch)
/// Each tick, given actor saturation `rho` ∈ [0,1] and runnable-backlog growth
/// `growth_per_s` (jobs/s, signed):
/// - **attack** — `rho > target + deadband` **and** `growth_per_s > 0` (saturated
///   *and* falling behind): cut the cap multiplicatively toward the floor. The
///   attack step is the **only proportional term**: it steepens as the backlog rises
///   faster (`f = attack^(1 + attack_gain·g)`, `g = clamp(growth/cap, 0, 1)`), so a
///   cold-start storm slams the cap to the floor in a few ticks while a mild
///   overshoot is nudged gently.
/// - **release** — `growth_per_s < 0` (draining) **or** `rho < target − deadband`
///   (idle headroom): grow the cap slowly toward the ceiling (`cap · release`).
///   Release is deliberately **slow and un-proportional** — this asymmetry is the
///   anti-oscillation guarantee (the compressor is the *outer* loop of a cascade
///   over the drain-guard servo; it must move slower than the inner loop or they
///   fight, which is what caused the historical sawtooth).
/// - **hold** — otherwise (healthy saturated peak: ρ high but backlog stable; or the
///   ambiguous mid-zone). Holding at a healthy peak is exactly the compressor knee.
///
/// Only the dimensionless `rho_target` matters as a tuning knob, and it is portable
/// across hardware — there is no absolute latency number to calibrate per box.

// ADR-0020 Tier-2: per-process-definition admission compressors.
//
// Tier-1 (the ρ / raft-fsync guard above) protects OUR shared write path — a
// global "are we the bottleneck" signal. Tier-2 protects each USER WORKLOAD's
// end-to-end latency independently: it keys on the in-flight instance backlog
// L_P of each BPMN process definition P (the authoritative engine counter added
// in ADR-0020), and by Little's law W_P = L_P / λ_P bounding L_P bounds the
// definition's e2e instance sojourn. Because the detection unit *is* the
// actuation unit (the definition), a definition that accumulates backlog is
// throttled without touching a healthy sibling that merely shares a congested
// job type — strictly more precise than per-job-type detection with per-process
// fan-in.
//
// The controller is an audio-compressor-shaped delay-gradient law on each
// definition's own pressure p_P ∈ [0,1]: a fast ATTACK term drives the backlog
// growth dL_P/dt → 0 (scale-free — it needs no absolute setpoint), and a slow
// RELEASE term biases the operating point toward the Little's-law band
// L*_P = W_target · λ_P (the one portable knob: the target e2e sojourn). The
// deadband is expressed as a fraction of λ_P so the same tuning holds across
// definitions of wildly different throughput.
//
// Actuation: the ~1 Hz monitor `step`s every definition from the cross-partition
// backlog snapshot and publishes each p_P as per-mille. Admission reads p_P for
// the target definition and sheds a p_P fraction of that definition's creates
// via a per-definition accumulator (deterministic, even, cheap) — so a partially
// pressured definition is *paced*, not bang-banged on the tick boundary.

/// Parsed configuration for the [`ProcessGovernors`] Tier-2 compressors. All
/// fields are env-tunable (see [`ProcGovConfig::from_env`]) but default to a
/// conservative, largely-inert operating point so healthy workloads are never
