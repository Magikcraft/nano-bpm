//! Cluster create-placement protection & load-awareness (ADR 0014).
//!
//! By default nanobpmn places `createProcessInstance` by **blind round-robin**
//! over every partition ([`crate::partition::PartitionRouter::next_create_placement`]):
//! it ignores whether the chosen owner is saturated, and a forwarded create
//! bypasses the owner's own admission gates. That is fine when every node has
//! equal capacity and load arrives evenly, but under **heterogeneous resources**
//! or **skewed ingress** it lets one node be overrun while peers sit idle.
//!
//! This module adds two staged behaviours, selected by `NANOBPMN_CREATE_PLACEMENT`
//! (**default `balanced`** — the engine self-optimizes unless explicitly told
//! `off`):
//!
//! - **`protect`** — every node self-protects: a forwarded create is subjected to
//!   the owner's admission gates and, if the owner is saturated, *shed* back to the
//!   ingress node, which **reroutes** to another owner (and only 503s the client
//!   when the whole cluster is saturated — true global backpressure). This closes
//!   the "forwarded creates skip admission" hole so no node is overrun by work
//!   placed on it.
//! - **`balanced`** (default) — implies `protect`, and additionally makes placement
//!   **load-aware**: each node periodically gossips a composite load index to its
//!   peers, and placement weights owners inversely to load so new creates flow to
//!   nodes with real headroom (work-conserving balance) instead of piling onto a
//!   saturated owner. A stale/absent peer hint is treated as full headroom, so an
//!   unprobed peer still receives traffic; the reactive `protect` shed is the
//!   backstop when the hint is wrong.
//!
//! `off` restores blind round-robin. On a single node every mode collapses to a
//! no-op (placement returns "local" with ≤ 1 partition; gossip is idle without
//! peers), so the `balanced` default is byte-identical on a single node and adds
//! zero overhead there.
