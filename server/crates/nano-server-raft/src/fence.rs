//! The leader-durable **fence epoch** register (ADR 0019).
//!
//! Every partition carries a monotonic fence value `(epoch, leader)` — the
//! "term/lock" of the leadership handoff + reclaim protocol. A node claims the
//! partition by promoting itself into the register at a fresh epoch, and peers
//! adopt the winning value, fencing off any stale leader. The two decisions
//! that keep leadership single-valued live here as one canonical, side-effect-
//! free implementation so the gateway binary (`ServerImpl::handle_promotion`,
//! `ServerImpl::next_promotion_epoch` in `server/src/main.rs`) and the
//! conformance test share exactly one fence rule — no drift surface:
//!
//! * [`wins`] — the total order over register values: a strictly higher epoch
//!   wins, and an equal epoch is broken by the **lowest node id**. The
//!   deterministic tie-break collapses a symmetric multi-way split (two
//!   survivors that each promote at the same epoch) back to a single leader.
//! * [`next_epoch`] — the epoch a node claims when it (self-)promotes: it
//!   re-asserts the SAME epoch if it already holds the register (idempotent
//!   reclaim re-entry — an unconditional `+1` there is the unbounded epoch
//!   climb / `leader_reject` storm), else overtakes a peer at `cur_epoch + 1`.
//!
//! The register's safety and reclaim-liveness properties are model-checked in
//! `formal/tla/raft/RaftHandoff.tla` (the `RaftHandoff` TLA+ spec). This module
//! is the anti-drift anchor for that spec: `tests` below replays the spec's
//! transition system against these exact functions, so the model and the
//! production fence rule cannot silently diverge.

/// Sentinel `leader` for a register with no known leader (`u64::MAX`). Any real
/// node id compares below it, so the very first promotion (at epoch >= 1) always
/// wins over the implicit `(0, NO_LEADER)` incumbent state.
